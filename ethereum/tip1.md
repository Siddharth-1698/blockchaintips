# What is Eth2 or Ethereum 2.0 or Serenity?
_Contributed By: B Vinoth Raj_  
_Created: Jan 19, 2022_  


Eth2 is a set of upgrades (in multiple phases) that improve the scalability, security, and sustainability of Ethereum.

**Phase 0: The Beacon Chain (live now)**
- The beacon chain doesn't change anything about the Ethereum we use today.
- It will coordinate the network.
- It introduces proof-of-stake to the Ethereum ecosystem.

**Phase 1: The merge (estimate Q1/Q2 2022)**
- Eventually the current Ethereum Mainnet will "merge" with the beacon chain proof-of-stake system.
- This will mark the end of proof-of-work for Ethereum, and the full transition to proof-of-stake.
- This is planned to precede the roll out of shard chains.
- Formerly referred to as "the docking."

**Phase 2: Shard chains (estimate late 2021 or early 2023)**
- Sharding is a multi-phase upgrade to improve Ethereumâ€™s scalability and capacity.
- Shard chains spread the network's load across **64 new chains**.
- They make it easier to run a node by keeping hardware requirements low.
- This upgrade is planned to follow the merge of Mainnet with the Beacon Chain.
